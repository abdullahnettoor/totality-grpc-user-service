# Assignment: Developing a Golang gRPC User Service with Search


**Objective:**
Your task in this assessment is to create a Golang gRPC service that provides specific functionalities for managing user details and includes a search capability. The primary objectives are as follows:
- Simulate a database by maintaining a list of user details within a variable.
- Create gRPC endpoints for fetching user details based on a user ID and retrieving a list of user details based on a list of user IDs.
- Implement a search functionality to find user details based on specific criteria.

&nbsp;



*Sample User Model:*
 ``` 
 {"id": 1,
  "fname": "Steve",
  "city": "LA",
  "phone": 1234567890,
  "height": 5.8,
  "Married": true}
  ```

&nbsp;

**Maintain Code Quality and Design:**
- Ensure that the code is well-structured and follows best practices.
- Apply suitable design patterns to enhance the maintainability and extensibility of your service.

**Develop and Test APIs:**
- Implement the specified gRPC service methods to accomplish the tasks.
- Write comprehensive unit tests to verify the correctness of your APIs.


**Input Validation and Response Handling:**
- Validate incoming requests to ensure they adhere to the defined requirements.
- Handle requests appropriately and respond with meaningful messages, especially in the case of errors.


**Implement Search Functionality:**
- Create a search endpoint that allows users to search for specific user details based on criteria *(e.g., city, phone number, marital status, etc.)*.


**Cover Edge Cases:**
- Identify potential edge cases and consider these in your implementation to provide robust and reliable functionality.


**Extra Brownie Points:**
- Use design patterns creatively to improve your service's architecture and efficiency.
- Containerize the entire application using Docker for easy deployment and scaling.

#
**Mode of Submission:**
- Create a private GitHub repository for your project.
- Include a README.md file in your repository with detailed instructions on how to:
- Build and run the application.
- Access the gRPC service endpoints.
- Provide any necessary configuration details.
- Share the link to your GitHub repository, and if necessary, provide a ZIP archive or a Google Drive link for submission.
